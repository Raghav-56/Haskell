--quicksort, a sorted list is a list that has 
--all the values smaller than (or equal to) the head of the list in front (and those values are sorted), 
--then comes the head of the list in the middle and 
--then come all the values that are bigger than the head (they're also sorted).

quicksort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (x:xs) = 
    let smallerSorted = quicksort [a | a <- xs, a <= x]
        biggerSorted = quicksort [a | a <- xs, a > x]
    in  smallerSorted ++ [x] ++ biggerSorted
